![version 1.0.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.4-green.svg)

**<big>MyHappyList</big>** - a very simple [AniDB](https://anidb.net/) *MyList* manager for Windows.

[Forum thread](https://anidb.net/thread83307)



## Features
- Add files to *MyList*.
- Mark files as watched.
- Calculate [ed2k hashes](https://wiki.anidb.info/w/Ed2k-hash).

And that's about it! If you're looking for something different,
have a look at [alternative software](https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=software).



## Download
See the [latest release](https://github.com/ReFreezed/MyHappyList/releases/latest) page.
No installation required - just unzip anywhere and run **MyHappyList.exe** !



## How to Update
Either update the program through `File` > `Update Program`,
or manually download the latest version and simply replace the old program folder with the new one.

### Updating from 1.0.x to 1.1 or Later
Move the `cache` and `local` folders from the old program folder to the new one to preserve settings etc.
These folders will automatically be moved to your
[`%APPDATA%`](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/help/folder-variables#appdata)
folder next time you run MyHappyList, so you only ever have to do this once.
