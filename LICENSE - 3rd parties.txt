including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works
thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting
